This course is for beginners. We will go through the basics and gradually move on to more complex structures. There is a test following each lecture. After successfully completion of the test of the lecture, you will get an access to the next one.

Listen carefully to the first lecture. Then proceed to passing the test. The test is under the video below the "Quiz" header. In case you find the test too complicated, you always can watch the lecture again.
