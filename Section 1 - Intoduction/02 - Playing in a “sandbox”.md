In this lesson we’ll learn what a “sandbox” is, using **jsbin.com** as an example, learn how to leave comments, familiarize ourselves with the console, and learn how to use the **console.log()** command. Do you want to save the results of your work in the “sandbox”? – Go ahead and take a **snapshot**!
