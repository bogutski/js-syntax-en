**What is variable?**

In this lesson, we’ll learn what a variable is, how it can be created, and that the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

### Summary

**Variable** – A variable is a “named storage” for data. To create a variable in JavaScript, use the `let` keyword (there is also `const` and obsolete var). You can assign certain data to variable using the assignment operator `=`.

Command format:

`let <variable name> = value; `
